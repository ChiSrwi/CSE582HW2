# CSE582HW2
● The detailed implementation of convolution and LSTM layers
● How many parameters does a CNN or LSTM layer have?
● Compare their training time for one epoch; feel which one is more
time-consuming
● Try to change the activation functions (e.g., from tanh to relu) to see
how performance change
